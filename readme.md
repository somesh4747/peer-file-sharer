# Peer File Sharer (Core Java)


A simple peer-to-peer file sharing application built using only core Java, without any external libraries. This project demonstrates basic HTTP file upload and download functionality, using Java's built-in networking and threading capabilities.

**Note:** This project uses Java's built-in `HttpServer`, `HttpExchange`, and `HttpHandler` classes to handle HTTP routes and requests, providing a minimal REST API without any frameworks.

## Features

-   **File Upload & Download:** Supports uploading and downloading files via HTTP requests.
-   **Multithreaded Server:** Handles each client request in a separate thread for concurrent file transfers.

              controllers/
                  FileController.java   # Manages HTTP endpoints for file api routes and CORS
                  DownloadHandler.java   # Manages HTTP endpoints for file download
                  UploadHandler.java   # Manages HTTP endpoints for file upload (manual parsing)
              services/
                  FileParser.java      # Responsible for making new threads for every request (using socket connection)
              utils/
                  FileUtils.java        # Helper for generating port number
